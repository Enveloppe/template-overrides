This repository contains the essentials files for the Mkdocs Publisher Template :
- [The github page template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/publisher-template-gh-pages/)
- [The Netlify Template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/publisher-template-netlify/)

Each time a bug-fix or a feature is added, a release will be made. This release will contains a zip of the changed file since the last tag.

If you use the auto_update.yml file, it will be posible that you miss the previous update, if your repo is old. Before the first auto-update, take the more up-to-date file from the repo.
