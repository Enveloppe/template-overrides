This repository contains the essentials files for the Mkdocs Publisher Template :
- [The mkdocs template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/mkdocs-template/)

Each time a bug-fix or a feature is added, a release will be made. 
The release will contains multiple zip files : 
- A zip containing only the changed files since the last tag,
- A zip containing all the files linked to the template (except the `mkdocs.yml` file)
    - `Docs` folder,
    - `overrides` folder,
    - `find_unused_media.py` script,

You can find workflows [here](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/actions).
